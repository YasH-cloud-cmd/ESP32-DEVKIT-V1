## 🧠 Why I Built This

Most off-the-shelf ESP32 dev boards are either overpriced or bulky for prototyping.  
I decided to design my own version — compact, cost-effective, and fabrication-ready for Indian labs.  
Built completely in EasyEDA with careful attention to routing, USB traces, and GPIO header symmetry.
